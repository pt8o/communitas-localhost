# communitas-localhost
This repo contains the Communitas Montreal 2018 website redesign in full, just with a throwaway localhost version of `wp-config` so peeps don't peep my credentials.

The site's eponymous theme uses Underscores as its base. Styles are written in SASS and there's a bit of jQuery. It's a lightweight theme that takes advantage of simple plugins like Advanced Custom Fields and List Category Posts to enrich its functionality.
